# Time Cache Libraries for `gettimeofday`

This project provides two implementations of a shared library that caches the `gettimeofday` system call on Linux systems. The cached value is updated at most every 100 milliseconds. Preloading this library will improve performance in blackbox applications that frequently call `gettimeofday`.

## Libraries

1. **Global Version (`libcache_gettimeofday_global.so`):**
   - Uses a global cache shared across all threads.
   - Synchronization is handled using a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t`).
   - Ensures consistent time values across threads.
   - Source file: `cache_gettimeofday_global.c`

2. **Per-Thread Version (`libcache_gettimeofday_per_thread.so`):**
   - Uses thread-local storage to maintain a separate cache for each thread.
   - No synchronization primitives are needed.
   - Offers better performance in multi-threaded applications.
   - Source file: `cache_gettimeofday_per_thread.c`

## Building the Libraries

Ensure you have `gcc` and `make` installed on your system.

To build both shared libraries, run:

```bash
make
```

## Usage

Running an application with the global cache:

```bash
LD_PRELOAD=./libcache_gettimeofday_global.so ./my_app
```

Running an application with the per-thread cache:
```bash
LD_PRELOAD=./libcache_gettimeofday_per_thread.so ./my_app
```
